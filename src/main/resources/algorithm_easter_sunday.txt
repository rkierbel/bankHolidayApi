A detailed explanation of the Gauss Easter Algorithm is as follows:

First, calculate the location of the year Y in the Metonic cycle.
A = Y mod 19

Now, find the number of leap days according to Julian’s calendar.
B = Y mod 4

Then, let’s take into account that the non-leap year is one day longer than 52 weeks.
C = Y mod 7

M depends on the century of year Y.
For 19th century, M = 23. For the 21st century, M = 24 and so on.
It is calculated using the following relations:
P = floor (Y / 100)
Q = ((13 + 8 * P) / 25)
M = (15 – Q + P – (P / 4)) mod 30

The difference between the number of leap days between the Julian and the Gregorian calendar is given by:
N = (4 + P – (P / 4)) mod 7

The number of days to be added to March 21 to find the date of the Paschal Full Moon is given by:
D = (19*A + M) mod 30

And, the number of days from the Paschal full moon to the next Sunday is given by:
E = (N + 2*B + 4*C + 6*D) mod 7

Therefore, using D and E, the date of Easter Sunday is going to be March (22 + D + E).
If this number comes out to be greater than 31, then we move to April.
Now the lunar month is not exactly 30 days but a little less than 30 days.
So to nullify this inconsistency, the following cases are followed:
if (D == 29) and (E == 6)
return “April 19”
else if (D == 28) and (E == 6)
return “April 18”
